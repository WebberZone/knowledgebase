Fastest way to create a highly-flexible multi-product knowledge base on you WordPress site.

## Description

[Knowledge Base](https://webberzone.com/plugins/knowledgebase/) is an easy to use WordPress plugin that allows you to create a knowledge base / FAQ section on your WordPress blog.

This is perfect if you have single or multiple products and want a single knowledge base with little effort.

The plugin was born after I tried several free plugins and themes out there and that couldn't fit my purpose. It's designed to be very easy to install and use out of the box.

You can view a [live demo of my own knowledge base](https://webberzone.com/support/knowledgebase/).

### Terminology

* __Articles__: A custom post type `wz_knowledgebase` is used to store all the knowledge base articles
* __Sections__: A custom taxonomy ( `kbcategory` ) used to create the knowledge base. You will need *at least one category* in order to display the knowledge base. These categories can be added under *Knowledge Base > Sections*
* __Tags__: Additionally you can use tags ( `kbtags` ) can also be used for each knowledge base article.

### Main features

* Supports unlimited knowledge bases using different sections with unlimited nested levels
* Inbuilt styles that display the knowledge beautifully and are fully responsive - Uses the [Responsive Grid System](http://www.responsivegridsystem.com/)
* Customizable permalinks: Archives are enabled so your knowledge base can be viewed at `/knowledgebase/` automatically on activation. You can change this in the Settings page
* Shortcode: `[knowledgebase]` will allow you to display the knowledge base on any page of your choosing. For other shortcodes, check the FAQ
* Gutenberg block: You can display the knowledge base using a block. Find it by typing `kb` or `knowledge base` when adding a new block
* Breadcrumbs: Default templates include breadcrumbs. Alternatively, use functions or shortcode to display this where you want
* Widgets: WZKB Articles, WZKB Sections and WZKB Breadcrumbs
* Inbuilt cache to speed up the display of your knowledge base articles

[This live demo](https://webberzone.com/support/knowledgebase/) is a working example of a multi-product knowledge base.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Check out the [FAQ on the plugin page](http://wordpress.org/plugins/knowledgebase/faq/) and the [Knowledge Base](https://webberzone.com/support/section/knowledgebase/).

If your question isn't listed there, please create a new post at the [WordPress.org support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/knowledgebase). It is the fastest way to get support as I monitor the forums regularly. I also provide [premium *paid* support via email](https://webberzone.com/support/).

### 404 errors on the knowledge base

This is usually because of outdated permalinks. To flush the existing permalinks rules simply visit Settings &raquo; Permalinks in your WordPress admin area.

### Shortcodes

Refer to [this Knowledge Base article](https://webberzone.com/support/knowledgebase/knowledge-base-shortcodes/) to details of all the shortcodes included in the plugin.

### Using your own templates for archives and search

WebberZone Knowledge Base comes inbuilt with a set of custom templates to display archives of the articles, category archives as well as search results. You can easily override any of these templates by creating your own template in your theme's folder or in `wp-content/knowledgebase/templates`

1. Article view: single-wz_knowledgebase.php or single-wz_knowledgebase.html
2. Articles archive: archive-wz_knowledgebase.php or archive-wz_knowledgebase.html
3. Category archive: taxonomy-wzkb_category.php or taxonomy-wzkb_category.html
4. Search results: wzkb-search.php or wzkb-search.html

### How do I sort the posts or sections

The plugin doesn't have an inbuilt feature to sort posts or sections. You will need an external plugin like [Intuitive Custom Post Order](https://wordpress.org/plugins/intuitive-custom-post-order/) which allows you to easily drag and drop posts, sections or tags to display them in a custom order.

### How can I report security bugs?

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/knowledgebase)
